## Repo Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to organize the notes, ideas, and wiki documents into one place. All documentation should be deprecated in favor of this repo. Anything to do with openventilatorregistry's overall workflow should also be added here.

This allows for pull requests/issues/ideas to be proposed and version controlled with git.

## Layout
[`organization.md`](organization.md): leadership hierarchy 
(directly ported from the sign-up document)


[`about.md`](about.md): information about us, mission statement, and the project specs 
(from the wiki, Google doc, and [ventilatorregistry.org](ventilatorregistry.org))


[`meeting-notes/`](meeting-notes/): contains all meeting notes, organized by date
(from the `Design` repo)

[`landing-page-information.rtf`](landing-page-information.rtf): contains the necessary, minimum information that a landing page and finished product must convey
