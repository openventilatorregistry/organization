# About 

## Mission Statement (intially from ventilatorregistry.org)
The Open Ventilator Registry aims to help hospitals and medical facilities share their ventilator inventory status and needs. Aggregated national demand can help raise awareness of the ongoing COVID-19 emergency, while helping suppliers identify which regions and hospitals have the greatest needs.

## Use Case (from initial project spec Google doc)
The setup of a contact index between hospitals and suppliers. 

Primary components:
- A hospital profile page, maintained by each hospital point of contact
- A business profile page, maintained by each business point of contact
- A demand index page, automatically generated and summarizing all hospital demand, utilized by business operators to identify urgent need
- A supply index page, automatically generated and summarizing all business supply, utilized by hospitals managers to identify available supply sources 

The governing principle in this proposal is that both supply side and demand side will be enabled to identify opportunities of order fulfillment and need. The contract negotiation is left to the parties involved, with VSP offering only status, discovery and the necessary contact information via profile pages. 

Implicit in the status information provided by both the supply and demand side is the ability to summarize time series data trends, in aggregate, across all businesses and hospitals. Greater participation will result in greater visibility to the macro trends, while also increases likelihood of supply-demand matching for the most urgent needs. 


## What are we doing?
The Open Ventilator Registry project is answering [the call](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/health/ventilator-shortage-coronavirus-solution.html) to provide a cloud-based national registry of ventilators and the hospitals that need them most
in order to facilitate their distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with a ramp up in ventilator production, there is still the significant problem of their efficient distribution.

## What are ventilators?
A ventilator is a vital piece of medical equipment that serves two main functions:
1. _Help patients to get Oxygen into their body_
2. _Help patients to remove Carbon Dioxide from their body_

With the recent heavy spike in illness related to the [COVID-19 global pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) many of the heavier hit countries are finding themselves lacking the equipment they need to treat patients. This is causes cases to become more severe, and can in many cases lead to a death that could very well have been prevented.

## What we're looking for
The Open Ventilator Registry is calling on software engineers, to help build a platform for hospitals to report on their stock of ventilators and if they have a surplus
or deficit.  Hospitals with a surplus can then send their supply to hospitals in greatest need.  We aim to create a nimble and decentralized supply chain and 
distribution network of these life saving devices.
