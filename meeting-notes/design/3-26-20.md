# Meeting Notes (3-24-20)

## Summary (by @supernoir)
- Minimal viable page is up and running (ventilatorregistry.org) - a reference in terms of UX/IA, not UI
- Critical design decisions will be put to a vote by active members
- Weâ€™ll have a daily roll call/standup at 8pm CEST/3PM EDT ~5mins

## Overview (by Max Fan)
- just as a temporary design/wireframe, the current site is at ventilatorregistry.org (this does not need to be used, but alternative designs need to incorporate the same information)
- we need to build consensus, preferably through voting and regular meetings (we will create a #meta or #updates channel for this purpose)
- we should vote on a design direction to take (we'll have an 24 hour voting period to help coordinate things)
- you can vote as long as you're active
- we will start to assign work once a clear direction has been established
